'''VIX''' is the [[ticker symbol]] and popular name for the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]'s '''CBOE Volatility Index''', a popular measure of the [[stock market]]'s expectation of [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] based on [[S&P 500]] index [[option (finance)|options]]. It is calculated and disseminated on a real-time basis by the CBOE, and is often referred to as the ''fear index'' or ''fear gauge''.

The VIX traces its origin to the financial economics research of [[Menachem Brenner]] and Dan Galai. In a series of papers beginning in 1989, Brenner and Galai proposed the creation of a series of volatility indices, beginning with an index on stock market volatility, and moving to interest rate and foreign exchange rate volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brenner |first1=Menachem |last2=Galai |first2=Dan |date=July–August 1989 |title=New Financial Instruments for Hedging Changes in Volatility |journal=[[Financial Analysts Journal]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=61–65 |doi=10.2469/faj.v45.n4.61 | url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/FAJ_articleon_Volatility_Der.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brenner |first1=Menachem |last2=Galai |first2=Dan |date=Fall 1993 |title=Hedging Volatility in Foreign Currencies |journal=The Journal of Derivatives |volume=1 |number=1 |pages=53–58 |doi=10.3905/jod.1993.407870 |url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/JOD_article_of_Vol_Index_Computation.pdf }}</ref> Brenner and Galai proposed, "[the] volatility index, to be named 'Sigma Index', would be updated frequently and used as the underlying asset for futures and options. ...

The resulting VIX index formulation provides a measure of market volatility on which expectations of further stock market volatility in the near future might be based. The current VIX index value quotes the expected annualized change in the S&P 500 index over the following 30 days, as computed from options-based theory and current options-market data. VIX is a volatility index derived from S&P 500 options for the 30 days following the measurement date,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp|title=CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Definition|last=Kuepper|first=Justin|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> with the price of each option representing the market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="auto" />

In addition to VIX, CBOE uses the same methodology to compute similar products over different timeframes. CBOE also calculates the Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXNSM), CBOE DJIA Volatility Index (VXDSM) and the CBOE Russell 2000 Volatility Index (RVXSM).<ref name="auto" /> There is even a VIX on VIX (VVIX) which is a volatility of volatility measure in that it represents the expected volatility of the 30-day forward price of the CBOE Volatility Index (the VIX).<ref name="Cboe Index Dashboard">{{Cite web|title=Cboe Index Dashboard|url=http://www.cboe.com/index/dashboard/vvix#vvix-overview|access-date=2020-09-02|website=www.cboe.com}}</ref>

The concept of computing implied volatility or an implied volatility index dates to the publication of the Black and Scholes' 1973 paper, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities", published in the ''Journal of Political Economy'', which introduced the seminal [[Black–Scholes model]] for valuing options.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Fischer|last2=Scholes|first2=Myron|date=1973|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637–654|doi=10.1086/260062|jstor=1831029|s2cid=154552078|issn=0022-3808|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Just as a bond's implied yield to maturity can be computed by equating a bond's market price to its valuation formula, an option-implied volatility of a financial or physical asset can be computed by equating the asset option's market price to its valuation formula.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nickolas|first=Steven|title=Implied Volatility|url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-options-implied-volatility-and-how-it-calculated.asp|access-date=2020-08-18|website=Investopedia|language=en}}</ref> In the case of VIX, the option prices used are the S&P 500 index option prices.<ref>{{Cite web|title=VIX Options|url=http://www.cboe.com/products/vix-index-volatility/vix-options-and-futures/vix-options|access-date=2020-08-18|website=www.cboe.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Olymp Trade promo code|url=https://honestdigitalreview.com/2019/08/olymptrade-coupon-code-promo-code-bonus.html|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Honestdigitalreview.com|date=24 August 2019 }}</ref>

The VIX takes as inputs the market prices of the call and put options on the S&P 500 index for near-term options with more than 23 days until expiration, next-term options with less than 37 days until expiration, and risk-free U.S. treasury bill interest rates.

== VIX Formula ==

The VIX is the 30-day expected volatility of the SP500 index, more precisely the square root of a 30-day expected realized variance of the index. It is calculated as a weighted average of [[Moneyness|out-of-the-money]] [[Call option|call]] and [[Put option|put options]] on the S&P 500:
: <math> \mathrm{VIX}= \sqrt{\frac{2e^{r \,\! \tau}}{\tau} \left(\int_{0}^{F} \frac{P(K)}{K^2} dK + \int_F^{\infty} \frac{C(K)}{K^2} dK \right)}
</math>
where <math>{\tau}</math> is the number of average days in a month (30 days), <math>r</math> is the risk-free rate, <math>F</math> is the 30-day forward price on the S&P 500, and <math>P(K)</math> and <math>C(K)</math> are prices for puts and calls with strike <math>K</math> and 30 days to maturity.<ref name="auto" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Papanicolaou |first1=Andrew |title=Identifying Links Between the S&P500 and VIX Derivatives |url=https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/research-articles/identifying-links-between-the-sp500-and-vix-derivatives/ |website=Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics |date=5 April 2016 |publisher=UCLA |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

[[Image:Vix.png|thumb|upright=2|Performance of VIX (left) compared to past volatility (right) as 30-day volatility predictors, for the period of Jan. 1990–Sep. 2009.

VIX is sometimes criticized as a prediction of future volatility. Instead it is described as a measure of the current price of index options.{{according to whom|date=February 2020}}{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Critics claim that, despite a sophisticated formulation, the predictive power of most volatility forecasting models is similar to that of plain-vanilla measures, such as simple past volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cumby |first1=R. |first2=S. |last2=Figlewski |first3=J. |last3=Hasbrouck |year=1993 |title=Forecasting Volatility and Correlations with EGARCH models |journal=Journal of Derivatives |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=51–63 |doi=10.3905/jod.1993.407877 |s2cid=154028452 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jorion |first=P. |year=1995 |title=Predicting Volatility in Foreign Exchange Market |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=507–528 |jstor=2329417 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1995.tb04793.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adhikari |first1=B. |first2=J. |last2=Hilliard|year=2014|title= The VIX, VXO and realised volatility: a test of lagged and contemporaneous relationships|journal=International Journal of Financial Markets and Derivatives|volume=3 |issue=3|pages=222–240|doi=10.1504/IJFMD.2014.059637}}</ref> However, other works have countered that these critiques failed to correctly implement the more complicated models.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Torben G. |last1=Andersen |first2=Tim |last2=Bollerslev |title=Answering the Skeptics: Yes, Standard Volatility Models Do Provide Accurate Forecasts |journal=International Economic Review |year=1998 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=885–905 |doi= 10.2307/2527343|jstor=2527343 }}</ref> Also overlooked is the risk inherent in attempting to time short term volatility.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Understanding the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) in Investing |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp |access-date=2025-09-29 |website=Investopedia |language=en}}</ref>

Some practitioners and [[portfolio managers]] have questioned the depth of our understanding of the fundamental concept of volatility, itself.

According to some,{{who|date=February 2020}} VIX should have predictive power as long as the prices computed by the [[Black-Scholes equation|Black–Scholes equation]] are valid assumptions about the volatility predicted for the future lead time (the remaining time to maturity).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} [[Robert J. Shiller]] has argued that it would be [[circular reasoning]] to consider VIX to be proof of Black–Scholes, because they both express the same implied volatility, and has found that calculating VIX retrospectively in 1929 did not predict the surpassing volatility of the [[Great Depression]]—suggesting that in the case of anomalous conditions, VIX cannot even weakly predict future severe events.<ref>{{cite web  |author= Shiller, Robert |author-link= Robert J.

An academic study from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[The Ohio State University]] examined potential methods of VIX manipulation.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Griffin, John M.|author2=Shams, Amin|date=May 23, 2017|title=Manipulation in the VIX?|website = SSRN.com | url = https://ssrn.com/abstract=2972979 | ssrn = 2972979 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2972979 |s2cid=157586475| access-date = 25 February 2020|url-access=subscription|doi-access=free}}</ref> On February 12, 2018, a letter was sent to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission by a law firm representing an anonymous whistleblower alleging manipulation of the VIX.<ref>{{cite journal | author=  Cornish, Chloe |date= 13 February 2018 |title=Anonymous 'Whistleblower' Claims 'Rampant Manipulation' of Vix Index |journal= [[Financial Times]] |url= https://www.ft.com/content/a89eba68-10b4-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277 |access-date= 26 February 2020 |url-access= subscription |via= FT.com }}</ref>

In practice, the implied volatility skew for VIX options is not always symmetric. While equity index options often exhibit a “smile” or “smirk” shape, VIX volatility skews can sometimes resemble a half frown, with higher implied volatilities on one side of the strike distribution than the other, reflecting market asymmetries in demand for upside or downside protection.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Natenberg |first1=Sheldon |title=Option Volatility and Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques |edition=Second |chapter=Chapter 24 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |location=New York |date=2015 |isbn=9780071818780}}</ref>

== Volatility of volatility ==
{{anchor|VVIX}}In 2012, the CBOE introduced the "VVIX index" (also referred to as "vol of vol"), a measure of the VIX's expected volatility.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 13, 2012 | title=Double the Fun with CBOE's VVIX Index|work = CBOE.com | url=http://www.cboe.com/micro/vvix/documents/vvix-termstructure.pdf|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> VVIX is calculated using the same methodology as VIX, except the inputs are market prices for VIX options instead of stock market options.<ref name="Cboe Index Dashboard"/>

The VIX can be thought of as the velocity of investor fear. The VVIX measures how much the VIX changes and hence can be thought of as the acceleration of investor fear.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is the VVIX (Cboe VVIX Index)? |url=https://www.vixfaq.com/what-is-the-cboe-vvix-index/ |access-date=2024-04-29 |website=VIXFAQ.com |language=en-US}}</ref>
